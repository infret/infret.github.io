# HTML basics
**HTML** is markup language designed to be displayed in browser.
Everything in HTML document is represented in **tags** - short strings
in angle brackets. **Nesting** tags can contain others, while
**self-closing** tags can't. Any tag ends with slash symbol inside.

Most of the tags are **semantic**. That means they have some meaning
and are used to describe and distinguish contents more accurately and
clearly, e. g. \<article\>, while technically they aren't any different
from non-semantic tags, such as \<div\>.

**Accessibility** is important trend in web-development which opens up
opportunities of browsing websites for people with disabilities. It
includes mainly making HTML **semantic**, declaring site language, correct
using of tags, especially headings, creating meaningful links and adding
alternative texts or placeholders where possible.

**Form** tags can take some input from user and then
**validate** and/or **process** it, both using tag attributes. An
example, \<input\> tag can be required to fill, or have minimum or
Maximum length, or have specific type of data, e. g. password; and after
submitting this form tag it's content is sent to server.

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** is widely used to increase the
number of site visits. Rational HTML structure of a website can raise it
in search results. As **site indexation** is made by search engine
bots, there are some requirements for it's best course. Not only good
texts and relevant words can help, but also reasonable page size and
contents, correct headings structure and anchor links with popular
webpages.

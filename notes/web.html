    <h1>How web works</h1>
    <p><b>Internet</b> is the global system of connected computer networks.</p>
    <p>
      Basically, it can be put another way: computers of global network are
      servers, and files they hold are websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Server</b>, or <b>Hosting</b> is the computer that has access to
      network and can share data to other computers. In fact, almost any
      computer can be server. Some companies provide <b>hosting services</b> -
      they share their computer resources with anyone to place data there for
      some cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any computer with internet access has unique
      <b>Internet Protocol (IP) address</b> to communicate with other devices in
      network. Any device in the same network can be accessed by IP address. IPs
      can be static or dynamic (change periodically).
    </p>
    <p>
      One computer can perform many internet-related tasks, e. g. act as
      multiple servers, and thus has multiple <b>ports</b>. Port is a number
      written with a colon after IP address. Any connection with IP accesses it
      through some port.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b> is what allows data sharing. It
      represents international standart of accessing websites. By default, port
      80 is used to access webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</b> is more prevalent today.
      That's basically encrypted and more secure version of HTTP, which also
      uses port 443 instead of 80.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Website</b> is some set of files, primarily document written in
      <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> It can be placed on a server with
      Internet access or computer without one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Domain</b> is, simply taken, website address. It is unique string that
      can be used as server address without relying on it’s IP. Domains are
      formed by <b>Domain Naming System (DNS)</b> rules and consist of multiple
      parts, at least two - some string and <b>Top Level Domain (TLD)</b>. TLDs
      aren’t random and can only be obtained from special organizations
      providing <b>domain registration services</b> for some cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Browser</b> is a software for retrieving websites from servers and
      displaying them to user. Web browser consists of
      <b>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</b> handler, which is responsible for
      finding specific servers and connecting to them, and
      <b>rendering engine</b>, which converts HTML document to acceptable view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Let's summarize</u>. There is one computer, that is used to access the
      website, let's call it <i>client</i>, and another, that hosts website, as
      we call it, <i>server</i>. The moment <i>client</i> enters some URL into
      browser, browser connects with DNS server, finds IP of server, related
      with entered in URL field domain name, and requests in format IP:port
      hypertext document using HTTP or HTTPS protocol, then renders received
      document and displays it.

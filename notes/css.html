    <h1>CSS & preprocessors</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is language used to style HTML, XML,
      SVG and other documents. It's syntax consists of <b>selectors</b> and
      <b>rules</b>, applied to every selected element on the page. Selectors are
      strings representing HTML tags, ids, classes, pseudoclasses etc. Rules are
      pairs of property and value, divided by <i>colon</i> and ended with
      <i>semicolon</i>. Every element is positioned on page by rules of one of
      different <b>layouts</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Normal flow</b> is the default layout, where elements are placed one
      after another, depending on their size and value of
      <code>display</code> value, e. g. block, inline, inline-block or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Floats</b> can align elements to different sides of parent containers.
      In combination of <b>margins</b> and <b>paddings</b>, they are powerful
      enough to create quite complex layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Positioning</b> allows to take elements out of normal layout flow and
      place them independently of other elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Css <b>flexbox</b> is single-dimensional layout method which can be used
      to create very complex row or column layouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Grid</b> is the most complicated and full-featured way to position HTML
      elements nowadays. It's two-dimensional and packed with a lot of
      properties allowing precisely predefine elements' place on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important trend in web development is <b>responsiveness</b>. Responsive
      design is set of practices aimed on reacting and giving feedback to the
      user of site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the prevalence of mobile devices with different screen sizes,
      web also becomes <b>adaptive</b>. According to adaptibe design, pages
      should be easily adoptable to any screen size. Adaptiveness is mainly
      achieved by <b>media queries</b>, sentences beginning with
      <i>at sign</i> and allowing to change CSS rules of page depending on
      screen size, feature support and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As sites become bigger and more complicated, the need for system to
      simplify writing CSS grows. Those systems called <b>preprocessors</b>. The
      most popular ones are <b>Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS)</b> and
      <b>PostCSS</b>. Both share common features, such as references, imports,
      conditional operators and even functions. Preprocessors change the way
      stylesheets are written and then compile them to normal CSS so browser can
      recognize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common problem of writing layouts is <b>scope leaking</b> of styles. Than
      means situation where changing styles of one element can suddenly change
      styles of another one. It occurs mainly because of similar classnames or
      selectors. <b>Block, Element, Modifier (BEM)</b> model of writing HTML
      classnames is created to prevent such errors. According to BEM, everything
      on the page can be described with three categories: <i>block</i>, an
      independent and re-usable part, <i>element</i>, an inseparable part of
      block, and <i>modifier</i>, specific set of properties of particular
      element. Block, element and modifier in classname are placed one after
      another and separated by <i>double underline</i> and
      <i>single underline</i>, accordingly.

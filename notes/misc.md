# Misc dev things

These days almost no frontend development is done without **Node.js**, CLI JavaScript runtime based on Chromium engine. It allows to run scripts without browser and even
create servers based on JS completely. **Node Package Manager (NPM)** is the biggest software library in the world and at the same time a helper tool for Node users.
NPM's packages are open source and made by users from all over the world, as well as NPM itself. Aside from hosting JS code, NPM helps with package creation, dependencies
resolution etc. **Yet another resource negotiator (Yarn)** is Facebook's alternative to NPM with some differences and additional functionality.

No code can be written without proper IDE or, at least, text editor. **Visual Studio Code** is partly open source and very popular among frontend developers code editor
with dedicated functionality that can be extended by addons. On of them is code analyser for identifying problematic patterns called **ESLint**. **Prettier** is another
famous extension that formats code and makes it look more consistent and readable.

Essential software for any programmer is **version control system (VCS)**, and **Git** is the most popular one. Git is open source and it's main purpose is tracking
changes of files in directory, managing repositories and branches with different versions of project codebase. Another popular VCSes are Mercurial and Subversion.
To preserve and backup all VCS information, it is often hosted on servers. **GitHub** is the most widely used free hosting for Git repositories, as well as Gitlab and
Bitbucket. Both offline and online Git tools are neccessary for any developer's career.

Abstracting from code, development is a labor process that obviously should be optimized. For this reason multiple process control techniques are used in IT.
**Agile** is collective name of various methods and approaches to management. It's main points are:

- Focus on the needs and goals of customers for all employees of the company

- Maximum simplification of the organizational structure, rules, processes etc

- Working in short iterative loops with intermediate results

- Active systematic use of feedback and retrospective

- Increasing the authority, independence, responsibility of employees

**Scrum** is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products with focus on a software development. In scrum process, teams of ten or
fewer members break their work into goals that can be completed within iterations called sprints in time intervals of 2-3 weeks. The team tracks progress in 
15-minute daily meetings, called scrums. At the end of the sprint, team reviews sprint, demonstrates what's done, and investigate their mistakes to improve continuously.

**Kanban** is a lean method of managing and improving work across humans. This approach aims to balance demands with available capacity and improve handling of 
production process bottlenecks. Work is visualized to give participants a view of progress and process from start to finish via so-called Kanban board, and tasks are 
pulled as capacity permits. The goal is to provide a visual process management system which helps decision-making about what, when, and how much to do. Kanban
is commonly used in software development in combination with other methods such as Scrum.

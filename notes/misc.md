# Misc dev things

These days almost no frontend development is done without **Node.js**, CLI JavaScript runtime based on Chromium engine. It allows to run scripts without browser and even
create servers based on JS completely. **Node Package Manager (NPM)** is the biggest software library in the world and at the same time a helper tool for Node users.
NPM's packages are open source and made by users from all over the world, as well as NPM itself. Aside from hosting JS code, NPM helps with package creation, dependencies
resolution etc. **Yet another resource negotiator (Yarn)** is Facebook's alternative to NPM with some differences and additional functionality.

No code can be written without proper IDE or, at least, text editor. **Visual Studio Code** is partly open source and very popular among frontend developers code editor
with dedicated functionality that can be extended by addons. On of them is code analyser for identifying problematic patterns called **ESLint**. **Prettier** is another
famous extension that formats code and makes it look more consistent and readable.

Essential software for any programmer is **version control system (VCS)**, and **Git** is the most popular one. Git is open source and it's main purpose is tracking
changes of files in directory, managing repositories and branches with different versions of project codebase. Another popular VCSes are Mercurial and Subversion.
To preserve and backup all VCS information, it is often hosted on servers. **GitHub** is the most widely used free hosting for Git repositories, as well as Gitlab and
Bitbucket. Both offline and online Git tools are neccessary for any developer's career.
